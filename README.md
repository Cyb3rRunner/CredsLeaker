# CredsLeaker v3
This script used to display a powershell credentials box asked the user for credentials.
However,
That was highly noticeable. Now it's time to utilize Windows Security popup!

# Features
- AD domain authentication validation.
- Tested on Windows 10. Needs to be tested on 7\8\8.1\ Servers.
- Can be modified (title, message etc.).
- Added WORKGROUP support.

As before,
The box cannot be closed (only by killing the process) and will keep on checking the credentials against the DC.
When validated, it will close and leak it to a web server outside.

2. Type your server IP and port in the ps1 script.
