This script used to display a powershell credentials box asked the user for credentials.

However,
That was highly noticeable. Now it's time to utilize Windows Security popup!

As before,
The box cannot be closed (only by killing the process) will keeps checking the credentials against the DC.
When validated, it will close and leak it to a web server outside.
